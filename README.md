# VCT-Score-Checker-Bot
This is a Python Script with which you can get score of the official Valorant Champions Tour match happening right on your screen, so that you aren't needed to watch the full stream and be distracted!

# What this bot does:
  (1) Pings the official YouTube livestream for the sccore in background.
  (2) Scrapes Nightbot's response of score data.
  (3) Stores it, and format it in such a way it is usable.
  (4) Creates a custom GUI, and inputs the data in it.
